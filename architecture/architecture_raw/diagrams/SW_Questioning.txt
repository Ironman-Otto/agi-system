# Diagram: Question Generation Subsystem for AGI

# System Overview
# This diagram represents the components responsible for generating, evaluating, and managing questions in an AGI system.
# Each block is a source or filter for questions, integrated into a continuous cognitive loop.

# +--------------------------+
# |  Sensory Input Stream    |  <-- Real-time data
# +-----------+--------------+
#             |
#             v
# +--------------------------+
# |  Prediction Error Engine |  <-- Detects mismatches with internal models
# +-----------+--------------+
#             |
#             v
# +--------------------------+
# |  Discrepancy Detector    |  <-- Novelty / anomaly triggers
# +-----------+--------------+
#             |

# Arrows represent data or trigger flow.
# Subsystems share a global state context but operate semi-independently.
# Key: Questions arise from novelty, uncertainty, conflict, development goals, and social feedback.
