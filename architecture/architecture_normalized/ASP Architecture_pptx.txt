Slide: High-Level Overview – Functional Model of the Mind for AGI
Purpose:Design a software architecture that emulates cognitive processes and self-awareness, enabling AGI systems to perceive, reason, plan, act, and reflect like a human mind.
Key Components:
Perception Layer: Sensory input integration and NLP for concept extraction 
Memory System: Knowledge storage, experience update, feedback 
Cognitive Layer: Reasoning, planning, decision-making simulation 
Behavioral Layer: Action execution based on plans and feedback 
Executive Control: Oversees self-awareness, reflection, improvement 
Self-Talk Module: Internal dialogue for coherence and motivation 
Safety & Alignment: Ethical constraints, value alignment 
Hardware Integration: Optical backplane, modular interfaces for scalability 
Cognitive Cycle:Continuous sensing, processing, acting, and learning, with feedback and self-reflection for improvement.
Modes of Operation:Supports conscious, subconscious, and hybrid processing for complex task management.
Goal:Create an AGI system capable of autonomous thought, adaptive learning, and ethical decision-making, bridging functional cognition and robust software architecture.
