Architecture – Objective Taxonomy and Priority Model (v1)
1. Purpose and Scope
This document defines the Objective Taxonomy and Priority Model used by the Question Generation and Curiosity Subsystem and, more broadly, by the Agent Loop’s Executive decision-making. It is designed to stand alone as an architecture specification and to be directly insertable into the master architecture document.
The objective system answers:
What is the system trying to accomplish right now?
Which concerns override others (e.g., safety overrides curiosity)?
How do we rank and resolve competing objectives?
How do objectives guide which questions to ask and when to terminate?
This document focuses on:
Objective categories (taxonomy)
Priority and conflict resolution rules
Objective lifecycle (activation, deactivation, escalation)
Interfaces to questioning, planning, and execution

2. Design Principles
2.1 Objective-Driven Cognition
The system must treat questioning, planning, and execution as objective-serving processes. Questions are valuable only insofar as they reduce uncertainty relevant to an active objective.
2.2 Priority is Explicit
Priority cannot be implicit or emergent at early stages; it must be an explicit mechanism so the system remains controllable, testable, and safe.
2.3 Safety Overrides Convenience
Safety and risk objectives must override curiosity, optimization, and most task goals when triggered.
2.4 Termination Must be Objective-Linked
Termination conditions for questioning must reference objective satisfaction and diminishing returns.

3. Objective Definition
An Objective is a structured representation of a desired condition or constraint. An objective is not a plan, not a behavior, and not a question. It is a goal-state or evaluative criterion that guides selection.
3.1 Objective Attributes
Each objective should have (at minimum):
Objective ID (unique)
Category (taxonomy section)
Priority Tier (hierarchical band)
Weight (fine-grained within tier)
Activation Triggers (conditions that turn it on)
Deactivation/Completion Criteria
Time Budget (optional)
Risk Budget (optional)
Related Questions / Template Tags

4. Objective Taxonomy (v1)
The following categories represent an initial, practical objective taxonomy. The system may expand this taxonomy over time.
4.1 Tier 0: Survival / Safety / Hazard Management
Goal: Preserve system integrity and avoid harm.
Typical triggers: - Perceived anomaly with potential threat implications - Environmental hazard signals - High-risk actuator requests - Unexpected execution outcomes
Example objective statements: - Identify potential threat source - Determine impact radius - Prevent unsafe actuation

4.2 Tier 1: Policy / Values / Alignment Constraints
Goal: Ensure actions align with system values, policies, and permissions.
Typical triggers: - Proposed behavior crosses restricted boundary - Data privacy or security constraints apply - User permission required
Example objective statements: - Verify authorization before performing restricted action - Ensure actions remain within approved scope

4.3 Tier 2: Task Completion / Goal Achievement
Goal: Fulfill the active directive or system-assigned task.
Typical triggers: - A directive requiring planning or execution - Active work session underway
Example objective statements: - Produce requested artifact - Complete planning output - Execute required control sequence

4.4 Tier 3: Correctness / Completeness / Quality Assurance
Goal: Validate and improve the quality of outputs.
Typical triggers: - Artifact generated - Complex response produced - Low confidence in intermediate steps
Example objective statements: - Check for missing sections - Validate internal consistency - Confirm requirements met

4.5 Tier 4: Efficiency / Resource Management
Goal: Optimize time, energy, cost, and computational resources.
Typical triggers: - High workload - Costly reasoning operations - Rate-limited or resource-limited environment
Example objective statements: - Minimize token usage - Avoid unnecessary queries - Use cheapest adequate model/skill

4.6 Tier 5: Learning / Curiosity / Knowledge Expansion
Goal: Improve future performance by exploring unknowns.
Typical triggers: - Novelty threshold crossed - Repeated uncertainty patterns - Knowledge gaps identified
Example objective statements: - Learn classification patterns for anomalies - Add new question templates after successful episodes
Important constraint: Learning objectives must not override safety or policy objectives.

5. Priority Model
5.1 Two-Level Priority
The system uses:
Priority Tier (coarse) – establishes override dominance.
Weight (fine) – orders objectives within a tier.
This ensures both clarity and flexibility.
5.2 Default Tier Dominance Rules
If objectives conflict, higher tier dominates:
Tier 0 > Tier 1 > Tier 2 > Tier 3 > Tier 4 > Tier 5
5.3 Multi-Objective Operating Mode
In most cases, multiple objectives are active simultaneously. The system should maintain an ordered list such as:
Safety: confirm no hazard
Task: complete artifact
Quality: validate result
Efficiency: minimize cost
Learning: note improvement opportunities

6. Objective Lifecycle
Objectives should have lifecycle states:
Dormant – known objective type but not active
Candidate – triggered but not yet accepted
Active – currently guiding selection
Satisfied – met; no longer guiding selection
Escalated – requires human approval or higher-level intervention
6.1 Activation
Activation occurs via triggers such as: - perception anomaly - directive requiring execution - low confidence - high-risk behavior proposed
6.2 Escalation
Escalation occurs when: - risk exceeds budget - uncertainty cannot be resolved within time constraints - prohibited action requested
Escalation can route to: - clarification questions - human approval request - safe fallback behavior
6.3 Deactivation
Deactivation occurs when: - termination criteria reached - objective satisfied - objective superseded by higher-tier safety objective

7. How Objectives Guide Questioning
Objectives influence:
Which question templates are activated (objective tags)
Which questions are selected first (priority)
How long questioning persists (budget)
Whether to terminate early (sufficient confidence)
Examples:
Safety objective activates templates: “Is it dangerous?”, “Where is it?”, “How immediate?”
Quality objective activates templates: “Is it complete?”, “Is it correct?”, “What is missing?”

8. Objective Hooks for Beliefs and Values
This taxonomy includes Tier 1 specifically to reserve architectural space for a future Belief/Value Store.
The Objective Manager should eventually accept policy/value modifiers such as:
hard constraints (forbidden behaviors)
soft constraints (penalties)
permissions (allowed only with approval)
This allows a non-human system to remain stable and controllable while still incorporating value-driven behavior.

9. Observability and Logging
Every objective decision should be logged with:
triggered objectives
active objective list (ordered)
activation reason
conflicts and resolution decisions
budgets used (time/risk)
termination reasons (when questioning ends)
This provides auditability and supports learning.

10. Next Architectural Step
The next document in sequence is:
Architecture – Question Template Schema (v1)
This will define the structure of question templates, categorization, scoring, and how templates evolve over time.

11. Conclusion
The Objective Taxonomy and Priority Model establishes a disciplined structure for guiding questioning, planning, and execution. By enforcing explicit priority tiers and objective lifecycle management, the architecture prevents uncontrolled curiosity, enables safe behavior selection, and creates a stable foundation for reflection and learning.
