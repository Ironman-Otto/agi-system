System Architecture – Foundational Skeleton
One‑Page Introduction (Product & Vision)
This system defines a general-purpose architectural framework for building AI-driven systems capable of performing meaningful work in both informational and physical domains. Rather than prescribing a single AI model or application, the architecture provides a scaffold for constructing intelligent agents that can interpret directives, observe environments, make decisions, execute behaviors, and learn from outcomes.
The framework is inspired by biological systems, particularly how living organisms: - respond to stimuli and internal goals, - coordinate perception, decision-making, and action, - operate continuously over time rather than as single-shot computations, - learn from experience to refine future behavior.
At its core, the system treats work as the fundamental organizing concept. Work may originate from a human directive, an internal goal, or an environmental change. All work unfolds as a traceable sequence of events, decisions, and executions, allowing the system to be analyzed, replayed, debugged, and improved.
The architecture is intentionally modular and layered: - Semantic layers focus on meaning, goals, decisions, and behavior. - Transport layers focus on reliable communication and coordination. - Persistence layers capture execution history for diagnostics and learning.
This separation allows the same architecture to support: - knowledge-generation systems, - autonomous control systems, - hybrid cognitive–physical agents, - research platforms for adaptive and learning behaviors.
The result is a practical, extensible foundation for building AI systems that are explainable, evolvable, and grounded in real-world execution rather than abstract model inference alone.

Elevator Pitch (Short Form)
A biologically inspired AI architecture that turns goals and events into traceable, executable work—enabling intelligent systems that can act, adapt, and improve over time.

Architecture Skeleton (Living Outline)
1. Purpose and Scope
Defines what the system is, what problems it addresses, and what it intentionally does not prescribe (e.g., specific AI models).
2. Core Design Principles
High-level principles such as modularity, traceability, separation of transport and semantics, and replayability.
3. Conceptual Model of Work
Introduces work as a first-class concept, including goals, projects, phases, and completion.
4. Event Model
Defines events as continuous occurrences throughout work, including event taxonomy and causality.
5. Decision and Behavior Model
Describes how decisions are made, behaviors are selected, and actions are initiated.
6. Execution Model
Covers tasks, sequencing, parallelism, state transitions, and execution monitoring.
7. Identity and Traceability Model
Defines Work IDs, Event IDs, Transaction IDs, sequencing, and replay semantics.
8. Communication Architecture (CMB)
Describes the Cognitive Message Bus as a subsystem, including message envelopes, routing, and reliability.
9. Persistence and Replay Architecture
Explains how execution history is stored, queried, replayed, and analyzed.
10. Error Handling and Recovery
Defines how failures are detected, traced, isolated, and recovered.
11. Learning and Behavior Extraction (Future-Facing)
Describes how successful work patterns can be analyzed and transformed into reusable behaviors.
12. Implementation Strategy
Outlines how the architecture maps to software modules, stubs, and incremental development.
13. Example End-to-End Flow
Walkthrough of a complete work instance from initiating event to outcome.
14. Extensibility and Application Domains
Explores how the architecture adapts to different AI use cases and industries.

Notes for Ongoing Development
This document is intentionally high-level and stable.
Detailed specifications (e.g., CMB, state machines, schemas) live in companion documents.
Architecture and code will co-evolve; updates to one may refine the other.
This skeleton serves as the conceptual anchor for all future design and implementation work.
