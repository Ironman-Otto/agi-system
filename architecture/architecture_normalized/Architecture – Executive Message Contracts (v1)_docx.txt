Architecture – Executive Message Contracts (v1)
1. Purpose and Scope
This document defines the Executive Message Contracts used by the Cognitive Executive (AEM) to communicate with all major cognitive modules. It is a standalone specification and can be included directly in the master architecture document.
The goal of this document is to ensure: - Clear boundaries between modules - Deterministic coordination - Replaceability and independent evolution of modules - A direct mapping from architecture → code interfaces
This document intentionally avoids implementation details while remaining concrete enough to guide coding.

2. Design Principles
2.1 Message-Driven Coordination
All inter-module interaction is performed via explicit messages, not direct function calls (even if initially implemented as such).
2.2 Executive Authority
All messages that result in decisions or actions flow through the AEM or are observed by it.
2.3 Structured, Typed Payloads
Messages must be: - Structured (JSON / dataclass / schema-defined) - Versioned - Explicit about intent and expectations
2.4 Forward Compatibility
Message contracts must support: - Additional fields without breaking consumers - Partial consumption (unknown fields ignored)

3. Message Envelope (Common to All Messages)
All messages exchanged with the AEM use a common envelope.
3.1 ExecutiveMessage (Logical Envelope)
Fields: - message_id – unique identifier - episode_id – execution episode identifier - source_module – module emitting the message - target_module – intended recipient (often AEM) - message_type – semantic message category - timestamp – creation time - priority – normal | high | critical - payload – message-specific data structure - version – message schema version

4. Core Message Types
4.1 Directive Intake Message
Message Type: EXEC_DIRECTIVE_RECEIVED
Emitted by: Directive Interface / Perception Layer
Payload Fields: - directive_text - directive_source (human | system | perception) - metadata (optional)
Purpose: Signals the AEM to initiate a new episode.

4.2 Intent Result Message
Message Type: EXEC_INTENT_RESULT
Emitted by: Intent Subsystem
Payload Fields: - intent_object - confidence_score - clarification_required
Purpose: Provides structured interpretation of a directive.

4.3 Question Episode Request
Message Type: EXEC_QUESTION_REQUEST
Emitted by: AEM
Payload Fields: - context_snapshot - active_objectives - inquiry_budget
Purpose: Requests the Question Generation Subsystem to initiate an inquiry episode.

4.4 Question Episode Result
Message Type: EXEC_QUESTION_RESULT
Emitted by: Question Generation Subsystem
Payload Fields: - questions_asked - answers_received - uncertainty_reduction_estimate - termination_reason
Purpose: Returns results of questioning to the AEM.

4.5 Planning Request
Message Type: EXEC_PLAN_REQUEST
Emitted by: AEM
Payload Fields: - goals - constraints - context_snapshot
Purpose: Requests a plan when execution is required.

4.6 Plan Result
Message Type: EXEC_PLAN_RESULT
Emitted by: Planner
Payload Fields: - plan_steps - assumptions - estimated_cost - risk_flags
Purpose: Returns a proposed plan for executive approval.

4.7 Skill Execution Request
Message Type: EXEC_SKILL_REQUEST
Emitted by: AEM
Payload Fields: - skill_name - arguments - approval_token (optional)
Purpose: Requests execution of a behavior/skill.

4.8 Skill Execution Result
Message Type: EXEC_SKILL_RESULT
Emitted by: Skill Executor
Payload Fields: - status (success | failure) - artifacts - execution_metrics - error_details (optional)
Purpose: Reports execution outcome to the AEM.

4.9 Reflection Trigger
Message Type: EXEC_REFLECT_REQUEST
Emitted by: AEM
Payload Fields: - episode_record - reflection_budget
Purpose: Initiates reflection and self-assessment.

4.10 Reflection Result
Message Type: EXEC_REFLECT_RESULT
Emitted by: Reflection Layer
Payload Fields: - outcome_assessment - self_talk_summary - learning_signals
Purpose: Returns reflection outputs for executive consideration.

5. Message Flow Summary
Typical episode flow:
EXEC_DIRECTIVE_RECEIVED
EXEC_INTENT_RESULT
(Optional) EXEC_QUESTION_REQUEST
(Optional) EXEC_QUESTION_RESULT
(Optional) EXEC_PLAN_REQUEST
(Optional) EXEC_PLAN_RESULT
(Optional) EXEC_SKILL_REQUEST
(Optional) EXEC_SKILL_RESULT
EXEC_REFLECT_REQUEST
EXEC_REFLECT_RESULT
The AEM may skip or repeat steps based on context and objectives.

6. Error and Escalation Messages
6.1 Execution Error
Message Type: EXEC_ERROR
Payload: - error_code - error_description - severity
6.2 Escalation Required
Message Type: EXEC_ESCALATION
Payload: - reason - required_action (human_review | abort | retry)

7. Versioning and Evolution
Each message type includes a schema version
New fields must be backward-compatible
Deprecated fields must be supported for at least one major version

8. Mapping to Code
This message contract layer maps cleanly to: - Python dataclasses - Typed dictionaries - JSON schemas - ZeroMQ or async queue messages
The contracts defined here are intended to become the canonical API between modules.

9. Conclusion
The Executive Message Contracts provide the connective tissue of the architecture. They allow modules to remain autonomous while enabling the Cognitive Executive to coordinate, govern, and audit all system behavior.
These contracts are the final architectural prerequisite before beginning serious implementation of the Reflection and Questioning subsystems.
