Architecture – Termination Metrics and Inquiry Budgets (v1)
1. Purpose and Scope
This document defines the Termination Metrics and Inquiry Budget Model for the Question Generation and Curiosity Subsystem. It is a standalone architectural specification and can be directly included in the master architecture document.
This document answers: - When should a question episode stop? - How does the system avoid infinite questioning? - How are time, risk, and value budgets enforced? - How does the system decide that it has learned “enough”?
The termination model is objective-driven, resource-aware, and safety-first.

2. Design Principles
2.1 Termination Is Not Failure
Termination does not mean perfect certainty has been achieved. It means sufficient certainty for the active objectives under constraints.
2.2 Bounded Inquiry Is Mandatory
All questioning must be bounded by explicit budgets. Unbounded curiosity is a system fault, not a feature.
2.3 Objectives Define “Enough”
Termination criteria are evaluated relative to active objectives and their priority tiers.
2.4 Safety Overrides Curiosity
Safety and policy objectives may force early termination, escalation, or human approval.

3. Definitions
3.1 Question Episode
A Question Episode is a bounded inquiry process initiated by a trigger (directive, perception anomaly, execution uncertainty) and terminated by explicit criteria.
3.2 Inquiry Budget
An Inquiry Budget is a quantified limit on questioning activity, expressed in terms of time, number of questions, cost, or risk.
3.3 Termination Event
A Termination Event is a decision point where the system ends the current question episode and returns control to the Agent Loop.

4. Termination Criteria Categories
Termination decisions should consider multiple criteria simultaneously.
4.1 Objective Satisfaction
The primary termination condition.
Examples: - Threat assessed as non-existent or contained - Required parameters obtained - Artifact meets completion and correctness criteria
Signals: - Confidence score exceeds threshold - Objective-specific success condition met

4.2 Uncertainty Reduction Plateau
The system should terminate questioning when additional questions provide diminishing returns.
Indicators: - Marginal uncertainty reduction below threshold - Repeated answers with no new information - No remaining high-value templates
This prevents infinite refinement loops.

4.3 Budget Exhaustion
Termination occurs when an inquiry budget is exhausted.
Possible budgets: - Maximum number of questions - Time elapsed - Computational cost - External API cost
Budgets may differ by objective tier.

4.4 Risk Escalation
Termination may occur when risk increases rather than decreases.
Examples: - Questioning reveals potential hazard - Required action exceeds allowed authority - Insufficient information to safely proceed
This often triggers escalation instead of silent termination.

4.5 External Intervention
Termination may be forced by: - Human override - System interrupt - Higher-priority objective activation

5. Inquiry Budget Model
5.1 Budget Dimensions
Inquiry budgets may be defined along multiple dimensions:
Question Count Budget – maximum number of questions per episode
Time Budget – wall-clock or CPU time
Cost Budget – monetary or resource cost
Risk Budget – tolerated uncertainty or hazard exposure
Each episode may track multiple budgets simultaneously.

5.2 Default Budget Examples (v1)
Safety objectives:
Low question count, low risk tolerance, immediate escalation
Task completion objectives:
Moderate question count, moderate time budget
Quality assurance objectives:
Moderate question count, strict termination rules
Learning/curiosity objectives:
Low priority, small budgets, preemptible

6. Termination Metrics
6.1 Confidence Metrics
Confidence may be estimated from: - Intent confidence scores - Answer consistency - Template utility success history
Termination thresholds should be objective-specific.

6.2 Information Gain Metrics
Information gain may be approximated using: - Reduction in unknown parameters - Reduction in answer variance - Elimination of hypotheses
Low incremental gain signals termination.

6.3 Cost-to-Value Ratio
Termination should occur when:
Estimated cost of next question > expected value of answer
This metric is critical for scalable systems.

7. Termination Controller Responsibilities
The Question Progression & Termination Controller must:
Track asked questions and answers
Track remaining budget
Estimate uncertainty reduction per question
Evaluate objective satisfaction
Detect plateau or escalation
Emit termination reason
Termination reasons should be explicit and logged.

8. Termination Outcomes
Upon termination, the subsystem must return one of the following outcomes to the Agent Loop:
Proceed – sufficient information to continue execution
Clarification Required – missing critical information
Escalate – requires human input or higher authority
Abort – unsafe or prohibited to proceed
Each outcome should include context explaining why termination occurred.

9. Logging and Observability
Each question episode must log:
Trigger event
Active objectives
Budgets allocated and consumed
Questions asked
Answers received
Termination reason
Outcome decision
These logs support debugging, replay, and learning.

10. Integration with Learning
Termination data feeds back into:
Template utility scoring
Objective prioritization tuning
Budget adjustment heuristics
Over time, the system should learn: - Which questions terminate fastest - Which templates are wasteful - Which objectives need tighter budgets

11. Safety and Governance Considerations
Learning objectives must never relax safety termination rules
Budget overruns should be treated as system anomalies
Escalation pathways must be deterministic

12. Relationship to Reflection
Termination marks the end of inquiry but the beginning of reflection.
Reflection uses termination outcomes to ask meta-questions such as: - Was the inquiry efficient? - Were the right objectives prioritized? - Should templates or budgets be adjusted?
This document provides the boundary between questioning and reflective cognition.

13. Conclusion
The Termination Metrics and Inquiry Budget Model provides the control structure necessary to keep questioning purposeful, safe, and bounded. By tying termination to objectives, uncertainty reduction, and explicit budgets, the architecture avoids infinite regress while preserving adaptive inquiry capabilities.
